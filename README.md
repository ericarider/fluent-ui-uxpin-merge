## About Fluent UI React

[Fluent UI React](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/tree/master/packages/react) is Microsoft's React-based implementation of their Fluent UI Design System; a collection of robust components that were designed to make it simple to create consistent web experiences using the Fluent Design Language.

## About UXPin Merge

Merge is a revolutionary technology that lets users import (and keep in sync) coded React.js components from GIT repositories to UXPin editor. 
The imported components are 100% identical to components used by developers during the development process. 
It means that components are going to look and, function (interactions, data) identical to the real product experienced by the users. 

[UXPin](http://uxpin.com) is a leading codeâ€“based design platform.

## How to use Merge integration with Fluent UI React?

Merge is currently only available to Merge-enabled users.

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Log in to your UXPin account.

## Charting

To augment the usefulness of this design system, we have also added five animated chart components, implemented using Uber's [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis) library.
